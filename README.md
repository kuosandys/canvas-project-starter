# starter for canvas projects

Some basic set-up for playing around with creating generative art on an HTML `<canvas>` element.

Background colour is currently set to [eigengrau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau), with the aim of contrasting with [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte) `#fff8e7`. Invert or substitute as you wish.

The document title provides a vague and friendly greeting to make getting started with your project feel as unintimidating as possible.

## scripts

Run the project with incremental build and live-reload:

```
npm start
```
